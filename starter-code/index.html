        <h2>Capture and Share<br>the World's Moments</h2>

        Instagram is a <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>beautiful</strong> and <strong>fun</strong> way to share your life<br>
        with friends and family.
        <p>
        Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look<br>
        and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can<br>
        even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a<br>
        new way to see the world.
        </p>

          Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
